* Some odd case links?

* 404's for
  - menu item "elements/pbcoreInstantiation", but "elements/pbcoreinstantiation" works
  - menu item "instantiationtracks", but "instantiationTracks" works
* malformed `</pre` tag getting displayed on instantiationphysical page.
* examples for instantiationDimensions has "unitsofmeasure" attribute, which isn't camel-cased, but it should be.
* is instantiationTimeStart supposed to be repeatable? Not sure what that means if there are > 1.
